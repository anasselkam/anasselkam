🌍 From Tangier to the digital world, I'm Anass El Khamlichi, diving into front-end development . Curiosity drives my code.

At the core, I handle HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, bringing web designs to life with a touch of React.js magic. Internship experiences taught me more than just coding; they honed my knack for meticulous project management and communication - essential in a fast-paced tech landscape.

The classroom might teach the theories, but my intern projects, including a to-do list app for better task management and a personal website, are where those theories mash with real-world application. 

Speaking languages? Besides coding, I communicate fluently in Arabic , and my English and German are on a steady climb!

If you're looking for someone who values growth, innovation, and teamwork, let’s sync up! Curious about my projects? Drop a comment or message!

Skills:  REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
